## `@type` Tag Reference

On using the `@type` tag:

### Enclosing Curlies
The enclosing `{}` are optional for YUIDoc, but we recommend using them in case
we are able to upgrade to JSDoc at some point in the future (where they are
required.)

### Nullable Type Shorthand
Fountainhead recommends following the JSDoc convention for nullable types where
`{?number}` indicates the type is a number or null.

### Non-Nullable Type Shorthand
Fountainhead recommends following the JSDoc convention for non-nullable types where
`{!number}` indicates the type is a number that CANNOT be null.

### Types of Classes or Native Types
If your type matches a class or JavaScript native type, the default behavior is
to create a link to the documentation for that class/type. This can be disabled
by setting `linkNatives` to false in `fountainhead.js`. Eg:

`@type {node}` produces a link to `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node`

### Capitalization
YUIDoc `@type` is case insensitive. You can use titlecase or all lower case
depending on your preference.
