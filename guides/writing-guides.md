title: Writing Guides with Ember Fountainhead
---

Ember Fountainhead makes writing guides easy. Guides can be written with markdown
and Ember components can be mixed in just like with your code descriptions.

#### Adding Meta Data

Guides can use front yaml to add meta data for any guide. The following configurations
can optionally be used to control how your guide is created:

Attribute | Use
--- | ---
id | Unique identifier for a guide. The id is also used as the url for a guide. If you don't set this it defaults to the file name.
linkLabel | Label used for guide navigation
title | Guide page title
