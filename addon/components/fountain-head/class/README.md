# Doc Page

Note that this set of components serve as the component group for creating a
class document page. Note that this type of class is not a traditional JS class,
but a YUIDoc class which is just an organizational concept.

This set of components is currently only set up to handle documentation for a
class, but should also apply for YUIDoc namespaces. Modules are documented
differently and should be handled under a `/modules` namespace.
