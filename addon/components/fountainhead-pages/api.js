/**
 * Fountainhead `/api` page component handles rendering the API sidebar, welcome
 * messaging and all API related subroutes including modules, classes and source
 * files. The `outlet` for this route is yielded by this component, which
 * is how we use components to handle rendering all of our pages, even with
 * subroutes.
 *
 * Because we want the default setup of Fountainhead to look like it's own app
 * we render everything in a `fh-page-in-page-wrapper` wrapper which is position
 * fixed to cover the entire screen. This allows us to have our own header and
 * footer even if a consuming application has one in their `application.hbs`
 * template.
 *
 * Page data is passed from the `fountainhead` service, which is the primary
 * store for the addon and handles fetching the meta data for the API docs.
 * @class FountainheadPages.API
 * @uses FountainheadRepoLink
 * @uses FountainheadSidebar.Sidebar
 * @constructor
 * @extends Ember.Component
