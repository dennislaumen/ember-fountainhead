/**
 * A totally rad component for using a text input to filter over arbitrary data
 * in search of a most exquisite match. This component makes only a the minimum
 * amount of assumptions necessary to be functional, but it's up to you to decide
 * specifically what it outputs, and what to do with that output in your consuming
 * context.
 *
 * ### Example:
 *
 * ```handlebars
 * {{!-- Minimal invocation within your hbs template --}}
 * {{fountainhead-omni-filter
 *   dataSet=fooData
 *   matchOnFields="chips, lacroix"
 *   clearAction=(action "clearCans")
 *   updateAction=(action "updateCans")}}
 * ```
 *
 * By default, the Omni Filter assumes that the `dataSet` you're passing into it
 * is a simple array of objects, and that the keys you want to match against in
 * each of those objects are all at the root level. However, in cases where the
 * keys you want to match on are multiple levels deep, or even within nested
 * arrays, you can pass a custom method into `traverseData` to tell Omni Filter
 * how to navigate your data set.
 *
 * ### Example:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // Parent context
 * someMethod(data, updateCallback) {
 *   dataSet.forEach(category => {
 *     category.items.forEach(updateCallback);
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ```handlebars
 * {{!-- Invocation within your hbs template --}}
 * {{fountainhead-omni-filter
 *   dataSet=fooData
 *   matchOnFields="chips, lacroix"
 *   traverseData=someMethod
 *   clearAction=(action "clearCans")
 *   updateAction=(action "updateCans")}}
 * ```
 *
 * Note that `data` and `updateCallback` are required arguments for your custom
 * `traverseData` method if you want it to actually do anything and communicate
 * back to the Omni Filter component.
 *
 * Omni Filter also requires that you pass in actions to handle when text is
 * entered into the field, and when the field is cleared out. The component will
 * always attempt to fire these actions, but if you pass nothing in, their
 * default behavior is to no-op, and hence nothing will occur.
 *
 * This architecture allows Omni Filter to be versatile in nature, so that you
 * can feed it whatever data you like, tell it how to examine your data, and
 * control how to use the data about what matches were found within your parent
 * context. The filter should not directly update state outside of its context,
 * which is why there is no option for block invocation; there's no point in
 * duplicating a lot of data and further confusing what comes from where. The
 * Omni Filter simply looks for matches and reports back on what it finds.
 *
 * What you do from there... is up to you ðŸŒˆ

   * This method is the meat of Omni Filter's matching logic. It's actually

   *
   * Then, either the default method of iterating over the objects in the data set,
   * or the custom data traversal method is invoked, and for each item returned
   * by the data traversal, an internal function `performUpdate` is run. This
   * function attempts to look up the specified keys on the current object,
   * and if that key exists, it runs the regex pattern against the key's value.
   *
   * Once the function is through with iterating over every key that Omni Filter
   * has been instructed to check against for matches, it reports back to the
   * parent context about whether a given object contains matchin data or not
   * via the `updateAction` action.
