# Ember Fountainhead

Ember Fountainhead is an in-app solution for rendering robust documentation for
your Ember application's source code. Fountainhead uses YUIDoc to render your
inline code documentation, with real, working examples of your component code
that you can test and see functioning in the context of your docs.

It Just Worksâ„¢.
