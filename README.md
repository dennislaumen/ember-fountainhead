# Ember Fountainhead [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/healthsparq/ember-fountainhead.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/healthsparq/ember-fountainhead)

Ember Fountainhead is an in-app solution for creating robust documentation for
your Ember application's source code. Fountainhead uses YUIDoc to parse your
inline code documentation. Your documentation is rendered in your app, allowing
you to include real, working examples of your component code that you can test
and see functioning in the context of your docs.

It Just Worksâ„¢.

## Installation

```
ember install ember-fountainhead
ember docs
```

See [healthsparq.github.io/ember-fountainhead/](https://healthsparq.github.io/ember-fountainhead/) for details and a demo.
