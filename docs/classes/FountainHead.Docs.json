  "description": "<p>Fountainhead <code>/doc</code> page component serves as the wrapping template for all of\nFountainhead. The <code>outlet</code> for the route is yielded by this component, which\nis how we use components to handle rendering all of our markup, even with\nsubroutes.</p>\n<p>Because we want the default setup of Fountainhead to look like itâ€™s own app\nwe render everything in a <code>fh-page-in-page-wrapper</code> wrapper which is position\nfixed to cover the entire screen. This allows us to have our own header and\nfooter even if a consuming application has one in their <code>application.hbs</code>\ntemplate.</p>\n<p>The <code>fountainhead</code> service is the primary store for the addon and handles\nfetching the meta data for the docs.</p>\n",
